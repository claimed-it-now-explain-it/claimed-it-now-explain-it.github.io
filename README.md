# **You claimed it on your resume, now explain it!**

Welcome to **ExplainYourResume** – a blog and open-source initiative designed to challenge developers to truly understand the technologies they list on their resumes. Our goal is to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application by presenting in-depth Q&A-style blog posts, technical challenges, and discussions around key concepts.

## 🌟 Vision
Many developers list frameworks, tools, and methodologies on their resumes without deeply understanding them. Recruiters struggle to differentiate between candidates who genuinely know their craft and those who rely on libraries without digging deeper.

**ExplainYourResume** aims to:
- Help developers solidify their knowledge by answering tough questions.
- Provide recruiters with effective questions to assess technical depth.
- Create an open-source collection of industry-standard screening questions.
